# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 20th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 3 Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** Very satisfying to have worked through 2 of the challenges without help. I did get stuck on an array challenge and had to look up the answer. Even with the answer I didn't completely understand the function so this highlights I should do more work around arrays.

### Day 1: 21st August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Basic Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** This was the most frustrating coding session yet. I've identified looping through arrays as a weakness that I need to work on. I struggled with all 5 of the challenges and even after having looked up the answer, I didn't fully understand the solution. Glad to be done with algorithms and go back to working on a project for my next coding session, but I do need to come back and master these challenges.
