# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 20th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 3 Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** Very satisfying to have worked through 2 of the challenges without help. I did get stuck on an array challenge and had to look up the answer. Even with the answer I didn't completely understand the function so this highlights I should do more work around arrays.

### Day 1: 21st August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Basic Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** This was the most frustrating coding session yet. I've identified looping through arrays as a weakness that I need to work on. I struggled with all 5 of the challenges and even after having looked up the answer, I didn't fully understand the solution. Glad to be done with algorithms and go back to working on a project for my next coding session, but I do need to come back and master these challenges.

### Day 2: 22nd August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted FCC Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** Much better coding session than yesterday, really enjoyed this one. The Bootstrap documentation was a lot easier to understand having worked in JavaScript the past few weeks. I restarted my FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page and am almost finished, this has been a small project I've wanted to redo for a while. I should be able to finish this quickly tomorrow and then move on to redoing my FCC Personal Portfolio. 

Side-note: Felt a lot fresher waking up early to code before work than trying to code late at night.

### Day 3: 23rd August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished tribute page and understood Bootstrap's grid system better. 

**Thoughts:** I worked out 2 problems with alignment that involved learning the grid system properly. One of the key lessons learnt was that I need to set a row and column for every section. I feel like I gained a much stronger understanding of how containers, rows and columns work in Bootstrap. I still need to practice more in order to master it but I definitely made some progress. I'm also happy to have finished my first "project", the FCC tribute page, I still have things to perfect but for a beginner first project I'm happy.
