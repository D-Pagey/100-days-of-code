# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 20th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 3 Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** Very satisfying to have worked through 2 of the challenges without help. I did get stuck on an array challenge and had to look up the answer. Even with the answer I didn't completely understand the function so this highlights I should do more work around arrays.

### Day 1: 21st August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Basic Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** This was the most frustrating coding session yet. I've identified looping through arrays as a weakness that I need to work on. I struggled with all 5 of the challenges and even after having looked up the answer, I didn't fully understand the solution. Glad to be done with algorithms and go back to working on a project for my next coding session, but I do need to come back and master these challenges.

### Day 2: 22nd August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted FCC Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** Much better coding session than yesterday, really enjoyed this one. The Bootstrap documentation was a lot easier to understand having worked in JavaScript the past few weeks. I restarted my FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page and am almost finished, this has been a small project I've wanted to redo for a while. I should be able to finish this quickly tomorrow and then move on to redoing my FCC Personal Portfolio. 

Side-note: Felt a lot fresher waking up early to code before work than trying to code late at night.

### Day 3: 23rd August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished tribute page and understood Bootstrap's grid system better. 

**Thoughts:** I worked out 2 problems with alignment that involved learning the grid system properly. One of the key lessons learnt was that I need to set a row and column for every section. I feel like I gained a much stronger understanding of how containers, rows and columns work in Bootstrap. I still need to practice more in order to master it but I definitely made some progress. I'm also happy to have finished my first "project", the FCC tribute page, I still have things to perfect but for a beginner first project I'm happy.

### Day 4: 27th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Bootstrap Portfolio from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Quite a frustrating session as I couldn't work out why Bootstrap wasn't working in my Codepen - only to realise 60 minutes later that it was due to my settings. I've deleted my old portfolio and am starting from scratch, I think I would like to be able to finish it in the next 1-2 coding sessions. Annoyed because I didn't feel like I learnt a huge amount from this session, although I did spend a lot of time reading documentation.

### Day 5: 28th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt some differences between the versions of Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled try to get Bootstrap 3.x and Bootstrap 4.0 working for my Portfolio site. Some things would work on BootStrap 3.x but not BootStrap 4.0 and vice versa. I ended up deleting my portfolio so I can start all over again as I was getting frustrated. 

On the bright side - I did manage to get my Tribute page working locally and then uploaded to Github.

 ### Day 6: 29th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a solid start to the portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** Started portfolio from scratch and decided to get the easier parts done first rather than getting frustrated with the navbar. It was a really useful session and really productive, I feel really happy with what I have so far and good foundation to build on. Now when I get frustrated I have the motivation to see it through as I already have done a chunk of work.

 ### Day 7: 30th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Portfolio 80% completed 

**Thoughts:** Another good pre-work session, I managed to fix some issues I had just by thinking of solutions in CSS and not needing to look anything up. I feel more confident about coding and am getting to grips with everything. However, this is likely to go away once I tackle building a navbar. I just need to finish off the social media buttons and add a navbar (hardest part) and then I'll be done with my 2nd project!

 ### Day 8: 31st August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished off FCC Portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** I finished my FCC Portfolio so that it is in a state that I would be fine with someone seeing it. I could have made it a lot cooler and flashier but I wanted to move on to more difficult projects and I think I have fulfilled the brief to a good standard. Since I plan to create my own portfolio from scratch as well then I'd rather work on that than perfect a portfolio I'm not really planning on using again.

 ### Day 9: 9th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learning about APIs, JSON and AJAX

**Thoughts:** After an extended coding break due to girl issues, I came back to it with a fresh challenge of using APIs and AJAX to build a random quote page. I struggled with applying the lessons on FCC so decided to visit Udacity and started studying a course on it. I've built the foundation of the page and now just need to pull the random quotes through.

 ### Day 10: 10th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learning about Arrays, AJAX and CSS

**Thoughts:** Since I didn't start the session until around 2am, I decided to spend the hour of coding on training videos rather than trying to struggle through AJAX Requests. To be honest, given some personal life stuff, I'm just glad I sat down to focus on coding for an hour. However, I'll do get back to getting my hands dirty in proper coding tomorrow.
