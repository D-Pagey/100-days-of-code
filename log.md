# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 20th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 3 Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** Very satisfying to have worked through 2 of the challenges without help. I did get stuck on an array challenge and had to look up the answer. Even with the answer I didn't completely understand the function so this highlights I should do more work around arrays.

### Day 1: 21st August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Basic Algorithmic challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:** This was the most frustrating coding session yet. I've identified looping through arrays as a weakness that I need to work on. I struggled with all 5 of the challenges and even after having looked up the answer, I didn't fully understand the solution. Glad to be done with algorithms and go back to working on a project for my next coding session, but I do need to come back and master these challenges.

### Day 2: 22nd August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted FCC Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** Much better coding session than yesterday, really enjoyed this one. The Bootstrap documentation was a lot easier to understand having worked in JavaScript the past few weeks. I restarted my FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page and am almost finished, this has been a small project I've wanted to redo for a while. I should be able to finish this quickly tomorrow and then move on to redoing my FCC Personal Portfolio.

Side-note: Felt a lot fresher waking up early to code before work than trying to code late at night.

### Day 3: 23rd August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished tribute page and understood Bootstrap's grid system better.

**Thoughts:** I worked out 2 problems with alignment that involved learning the grid system properly. One of the key lessons learnt was that I need to set a row and column for every section. I feel like I gained a much stronger understanding of how containers, rows and columns work in Bootstrap. I still need to practice more in order to master it but I definitely made some progress. I'm also happy to have finished my first "project", the FCC tribute page, I still have things to perfect but for a beginner first project I'm happy.

### Day 4: 27th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Bootstrap Portfolio from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Quite a frustrating session as I couldn't work out why Bootstrap wasn't working in my Codepen - only to realise 60 minutes later that it was due to my settings. I've deleted my old portfolio and am starting from scratch, I think I would like to be able to finish it in the next 1-2 coding sessions. Annoyed because I didn't feel like I learnt a huge amount from this session, although I did spend a lot of time reading documentation.

### Day 5: 28th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt some differences between the versions of Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled try to get Bootstrap 3.x and Bootstrap 4.0 working for my Portfolio site. Some things would work on BootStrap 3.x but not BootStrap 4.0 and vice versa. I ended up deleting my portfolio so I can start all over again as I was getting frustrated.

On the bright side - I did manage to get my Tribute page working locally and then uploaded to Github.

 ### Day 6: 29th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a solid start to the portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Started portfolio from scratch and decided to get the easier parts done first rather than getting frustrated with the navbar. It was a really useful session and really productive, I feel really happy with what I have so far and good foundation to build on. Now when I get frustrated I have the motivation to see it through as I already have done a chunk of work.

 ### Day 7: 30th August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Portfolio 80% completed

**Thoughts:** Another good pre-work session, I managed to fix some issues I had just by thinking of solutions in CSS and not needing to look anything up. I feel more confident about coding and am getting to grips with everything. However, this is likely to go away once I tackle building a navbar. I just need to finish off the social media buttons and add a navbar (hardest part) and then I'll be done with my 2nd project!

 ### Day 8: 31st August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished off FCC Portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I finished my FCC Portfolio so that it is in a state that I would be fine with someone seeing it. I could have made it a lot cooler and flashier but I wanted to move on to more difficult projects and I think I have fulfilled the brief to a good standard. Since I plan to create my own portfolio from scratch as well then I'd rather work on that than perfect a portfolio I'm not really planning on using again.

 ### Day 9: 9th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learning about APIs, JSON and AJAX

**Thoughts:** After an extended coding break due to girl issues, I came back to it with a fresh challenge of using APIs and AJAX to build a random quote page. I struggled with applying the lessons on FCC so decided to visit Udacity and started studying a course on it. I've built the foundation of the page and now just need to pull the random quotes through.

 ### Day 10: 10th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learning about Arrays, AJAX and CSS

**Thoughts:** Since I didn't start the session until around 2am, I decided to spend the hour of coding on training videos rather than trying to struggle through AJAX Requests. To be honest, given some personal life stuff, I'm just glad I sat down to focus on coding for an hour. However, I'll do get back to getting my hands dirty in proper coding tomorrow.

### Day 11: 12th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Sorted API function

**Thoughts:** Finished working on the API function, just working on the Twitter button and some styling and I'll have finished my first intermediate project. I was getting frustrated with not knowing things 100% but I learnt to struggle through it and try to understand things as I go.

**Link to work:** [FCC Random Quote Page](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/eEXRZy)

### Day 12: 13th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Intermediate FCC Project

**Thoughts:** I hacked together some dodgy code to make my Twitter button work as desired. I will likely come back to it in the future and beat myself up about it. On the bright side, I have now finished my first intermediate Free Code Camp project which I am happy about! I find that my feelings on coding alternate from despair to joy depending on the session. I know I've just got to keep learning and coding every day. I have some options of what to work on next so pretty excited for my coding session tomorrow.

### Day 13: 14th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Successfully pushed local project to Github repo

**Thoughts:** I am pretty happy that I've started to learn and wrap my head around Git Bash commands. I pushed my local Random Quote Machine to Github and it all worked. It kind of made sense in my head as well which is a first, I'm starting to feel optimistic that the various aspects of being a developer are clicking into place. From now on I will try update my Github exclusively using Git, I just need to learn how to update a repo when I don't have it stored locally...

### Day 14: 15th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished an Intermed Algorithmic Script

**Thoughts:** Not the most productive session, watched an Egghead video and a YT video on Pull Requests. After that I started on the intermediate algorithmic scripts on FCC. I had to look up the first one however I have almost wrapped my head around the second one. I'm not going to look up the answer and make sure I work it out myself. I like that I have the option to work on Git/Github tasks, FCC Projects or FCC Algorithms depending on my mood!

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/d-pagey)

### Day 15: 17th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed more FCC Intermediate Algorithms

**Thoughts:** Managed to hack my way through an intermediate challenge without looking anything up. However the next challenge I really struggled with and had to look up the solution, which always makes me feel like I'm cheating. Overall I'm half wrapping my head around these challenges but I guess slowly but surely I'm learning. I think that in the future I will go back over all the algorithm challenges and redo them until I can complete them off the top of my head.

### Day 16: 18th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Published FCC Portfolio to own domain

**Thoughts:** Pretty happy with today's session as I managed to push my website via Git with no problems. My own domain works now with my FCC Portfolio and I have even more inspiration to update and perfect it. Even though I know this isn't what learning is about - I was quite happy that I didn't have any huge stumbling blocks today.

### Day 17: 19th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started FCC Local Weather App

**Thoughts:** Made a very basic design for the app and then learnt about getElementById and how to manipulate the HTML with JavaScript. I feel like this project is going to be quite challenging but I made some progress with it and learnt more JavaScript.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GMgrwM)

### Day 18: 20th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made Local Weather App work locally and pushed to GitHub

**Thoughts:** Not the most productive pre-work coding session. Watched a video on Branches and Pull Requests then made my Local Weather App work locally. Ran into issues with linking the CSS and then getting the CSS colors to work without "!important" - which I didn't actually achieve. Finally pushed that local repo to GitHub just to track progress on my profile but overall don't feel like I learnt or did that much this morning.

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/D-Pagey)

### Day 19: 25th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Create a button to gather latitude/longitude of user.

**Thoughts:** Probably my worst coding session to date. I felt really tired after a long day at work and not in the right mindset to push myself out of comfort zone and learn. I tried an FCC intermediate algorithm and didn't get far off the start, then had to cheat and find the answer and still didn't understand it.
I then moved on to working on my Local Weather App project and only managed to add a button that pulls the co-ordinates, which isn't what I wanted.
After a while I got frustrated and resorted to watching coding related YT videos. Although I did decide to push my pathetic coding session to Github for the sake of creating the habit of pushing all my code.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather Repo](https://github.com/D-Pagey/FCC-Local-Weather)

### Day 20: 27th September 2017

**Today's Progress:** Researched and worked out what I need to do

**Thoughts:** I feel better about this session than the last one, despite not really making much headway or pushing anything to Github. I researched a lot of other peoples projects and worked out what I need to do in order to pull users' location.
I think I massively udnerestimate how long it takes to learn and complete a project and therefore get frustrated when I can't do things straight away.

### Day 21: 30th September 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Finished 2x Intermediate Algorithim Challenges

**Thoughts:** I watched a few YT videos on Regular Expressions and gained a better understanding. In my coding hour, I managed to complete 2 of the intermediate algorithmic challenges. I don't think I give myself enough credit for how much I do know at this point as I picked up the areas I had to look up quite quickly. Anyway, 2 steps closer to achievement the Front End Certification from FCC.

### Day 22: 1st October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt Regex, Git and API calls.

**Thoughts:** Quite a productive day having spent over 3 hours either coding or learning about coding concepts. Completed a regular expression tutorial, finished watching a course on Git commands and wrapped my head around API calls. I feel confident that I know what I need to do to functionally do the Local Weather App, now I just need to sit down and do it. With hindsight, I should have spent more time today actually coding but I do think a lot of what I watched has sunk in.

### Day 23: 2nd October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Key breakthroughs in Local Weather App

**Thoughts:** This has by far been my best coding session yet! I finally understood some really basic concepts that were about 80% there before. There were a few problems I managed to solve like: invoking a function, understanding a callback function, and bugfixing using the console. I made big headway with my Local Weather App and I feel like things are finally starting to click. I'm so happy with how this session - plenty of working through problems with trial and error to actually understand how the code works.

### Day 24: 4th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** More accurate weather data pulled + displayed

**Thoughts:** Successfully pulled the JSON data of the users' current location from the Open Weather API. I feel like I've done the hardest technical part of the project and now just need to work on 2 more simple aspects and then make it all look nice with HTML and CSS. I like the idea that this app could be the first Github project that has more JavaScript than HTML. Still quite a bit to go but enjoying the learning progress.

### Day 25: 7th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Weather dependent body class + relayout

**Thoughts:** Big update on the project thanks to a pair programming session I had with the Front End Lead at work. Managed to set up the body class to be dependent on the weather data, so the background color changes on the weather. Now need to transfer this to an image and I'll have done another user story. I'm making progress and just need to up the consistency of my coding, today was a bit of a write off as was hungover.

**Link to work:** [Local Weather Repo](https://github.com/D-Pagey/FCC-Local-Weather/)

### Day 26: 8th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added image and button, started functionality.

**Thoughts:** Quite a productive session with making headway on 2 remaining user stories. The most difficult parts still to come but things are moving forward. I also think the process of trying new things or the learning curve is actually getting slightly shorter. I feel rather optimistic about coding in general, however I am looking forward to moving on from this project. Half of me wants it to be perfect and the other half wants to work on something new.

### Day 27: 15th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Used Fetch API

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've done a proper coding session, although I have been doing smaller and mini ones in between. I've been quite anxious to put in a big coding session as I feel like I was in a bit of a mess with this Local Weather App project. However, I have organised the code better and replaced the XML HTTP Request with the Fetch API. I am slowly making progress and just need to keep coding each day and pushing my code to Github.

**Link to work:** [CodePen: Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GMgrwM)

### Day 28: 16th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed toggle button

**Thoughts:** I'm really happy to have finished coding the toggle button on my weather app. I really wanted to do it in native JavaScript and I struggled through with the guidance of a friend from work. It feels so satisfying to get to the bottom of a difficult problem and then have something to show for it at the end. An added bonus is that for the first time, my project is now majority JavaScript!

**Link to work:** [CodePen: Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GMgrwM)

### Day 29: 22nd October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Weather App project!

**Thoughts:** Had a really good coding session today, probably the longest time I've spent coding in one day. I've done 5x Intermediate challenges on FCC and finished the weather app project. Overall I'm feeling a lot more confident in quite a few aspects of coding and I'm so glad I've decided to do this challenge. I have learnt so much from working on this project both technically and personally. I'm full of confidence and just want to get started on the next project :)

**Link to work:** [CodePen: Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GMgrwM)

### Day 30: 23rd October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated GitHub page.

**Thoughts:** I spent well over an hour this evening simply updating all the repos on my GitHub page. This involved changing the repo names and therefore the remotes in Git. More importantly, I reviewed all my old code and it was amazing to see how much I had learnt in the short time I've been doing this. I've identified one of the projects I'd like to almost redo, hopefully it will be simply replacing the JQuery with native JavaScript.

**Link to work:** [GitHub page](https://github.com/D-Pagey)

### Day 31: 25th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated old project with better code.  

**Thoughts:** Revisited my Random Quote project as 1) it used JQuery and 2) I didn't understand my own code. I've managed to use the fetch API again but the project is no longer fully functional. I have a better comprehension of working with the DOM and APIs so it shouldn't take long to get the project working again, and for me to move on to a new project.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Random Quoter](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/eEXRZy)

### Day 32: 26th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed a key API issue.

**Thoughts:** Changed the API used so that each click does in fact bring a random quote. It feels good to have code on a project that I fully understand. A part of me wants to work on new projects, although I quickly realise the importance of making sure old code is updated and improved. One more user story and my old project will be up to a good standard.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Random Quoter](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/eEXRZy)

### Day 33: 28th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished recoding an old project.

**Thoughts:** I'm very happy to have finished the Random Quote Machine for the 2nd time. The first time round it felt good to hack together something that worked. However, this time round I feel even better as my project works functionally *and* I understand all of the code in it. I feel like I've taken a big step in my coding over the last 2 weeks and I want to keep up the momentum.

**Link to work:** [GitHub - Random Quote Machine](https://github.com/D-Pagey/Quoter)

### Day 34: 29th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Wikipedia Viewer

**Thoughts:** I updated all my Github READMEs and then quickly built the foundation for my next project. I was actually surprised at: 1) how quick I could whip up a Bootstrap layout and 2) I was able to write a JavaScript function off the top of my head. This project seems deceptively easy so it will be interesting to see how I get on with it.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 35: 30th October 2017

**Today's Progress:** Algorithm challenges + Wikipedia API Research

**Thoughts:** Today I had a holiday from work and spent roughly 3.5 hours focused purely on either the algorithmic challenges or my new Wikipedia project. I worked through a difficult algorithmic challenge by myself without looking anything up, and then half completed another one before having to look up the solution. The rest of my time was spent trying to learn about the Wikipedia API call and to be honest, it's gone slower than I would have liked.  I've not made much progress on my Wikipedia project's code, but I think I have a slightly better understanding of what I need to do.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 36: 31st October 2017

**Today's Progress:** API call on Wikipedia project + slideshow on personal website

**Thoughts:** I had a pretty good coding day today making progress on both my personal website and the Wikipedia project. For my personal website I created a click-through slideshow of pictures which I made for the sake of seeing if I could code it. With the Wikipedia project, I still don't fully understand why some things work and other things don't but at the every least I managed to pull the data I need from Wikipedia - which is a positive sign.

**Link to work:** [Personal Website](http://www.danpage.co.uk)

### Day 37: 5th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started to display the API call content

**Thoughts:** Slowly wrapping my head around this Wikipedia project. Managed to get the titles and snippets displayed on the page by creating DOM elements in JavaScript. Feel like I have a long way to go but feel confident I'll get there in the end.  

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 38: 6th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created layout to display search results

**Thoughts:** A colleague at work suggested I build how I want the layout to look and then work backwards. This made so much more sense to me than what I was doing. I built the foundation for how I want it to look and managed to input data from the API call into the layout.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 39: 8th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Title, snippet + link displays in HTML from search results.

**Thoughts:** Hardcoded all the HTML elements so I had something to push the API call data into. I feel like I'm over the hill with my understanding of this project although there is still quite a lot to do. There are quite a few aspects of my code that I know work but don't fully understand yet e.g. the API call to Wikipedia. I don't really like the feeling of not knowing what my own code does.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 40: 11th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Almost done fuctionally.

**Thoughts:** Bit of a frustrating hour as didn't make enough progress to actually push some code. Basically the project works but I can't link the users' input and the Fetch API. I feel like it might just be a case of misunderstanding scope and closures and I think I'm so close to solving this problem. Once I get this right then functionally the project will be complete. I'm going to put in another hour to try and get through it.

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 41: 12th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed a big problem and added functionality to add/remove divs.

**Thoughts:** Made quite a lot of progress since the last session. I fixed something that instantly made my project work properly and it was simply changing a Submit input to a button so it didn't refresh the page when clicked. I've also added functionality to add and remove divs as the user searches multiple times. I'm really happy with the progress I've made on this and this makes the 2nd project on GitHub with a majority JavaScript code in it!  

**Link to work:** [CodePen - Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/wrZRqR)

### Day 42: 18th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finish Wikipedia. Now recreating ClearScore homepage.

**Thoughts:** It's been a week since I've put in a solid hour but I have been coding and pushing to GitHub every day. In that time I finished off my Wikipedia project (although I do plan to come back and improve the styling and refactor the JS) and now I have moved on to recreating the ClearScore homepage. This is a project that my colleague and mentor set me and focuses on improving my HTML and CSS. I've got off to an ok start but still a lot to do to make it look close to the real thing.

### Day 43: 19th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tribute project: Bootstrap to FlexBox.

**Thoughts:** Today I have been focusing on learning FlexBox and Git better. I have done various tutorials on each and have started to remove all the Bootstrap from my Tribute Page project and replace it with FlexBox. So far it has been a good learning experience for me and I already feel like my CSS skills are coming along nicely. It also feels good to have built the web page without relying on any framework or library, and this time round I can have a go at making it mobile-responsive. 

**Link to work:** [GitHub - Tribute Page](https://github.com/D-Pagey/Tribute/commit/ec5bd8a1d441aed2c9d01e8afc0858c9e3d653be)

### Day 44: 20th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tribute project: Continuing to restyle this project with Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Not much to report other than just continued working on restyling this project. I think this has been a good idea to go over all the code again and I'm learning a lot about (and becoming more confident with) core HTML/CSS. 

**Link to work:** [GitHub - Tribute Page](https://github.com/D-Pagey/Tribute/commit/ec5bd8a1d441aed2c9d01e8afc0858c9e3d653be)

### Day 45: 25th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tribute project: Finish off the mobile responsive design. 

**Thoughts:** Finally finished off the CSS styling of the project including making the design mobile responsive. It feels pretty cool to have properly finished a project knowing I wrote all the code without libraries or frameworks. The next step would be to add a popup/modal that shows the brief and user stories for the project. I'll come back to that though as now I just want to make all my projects mobile responsive in my own native CSS.

### Day 46: 26th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Almost finished restyling FCC Portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Have coded for 3 hours today and almost finished styling the FreeCodeCamp portfolio in native CSS. It's easier refactoring the CSS the 2nd time round but still running into some challenges. An hour or two more and I'll likely have finished this project and I think all my other projects are significantly simpler in terms of design.

### Day 47: 27th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Amending Media Queries on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** This evening I went back to my 1st project and spent an hour amending the Media Queries on the Tribute Page. I'm obsessing over it being perfect but I'm also aware that someone is going to come along and show me how much better my CSS could be. I don't want to spend any more time on this Tribute Page so hopefully I can focus on refactoring all my other projects. 

**Link to work:** [GitHub - Tribute Page](https://github.com/D-Pagey/Tribute)

### Day 48: 30th November 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated CSS on Tribute Page with styling best practices.

**Thoughts:** A FE Dev at work/my mentor taught me some CSS best practices and so I refactored my CSS with these. However the media queries broke so I deleted them as I want to start again on those. Not much more to say on this other than looking forward to finishing these.

### Day 49: 3rd December 2017

**Today's Progress:** Refactored 3/5 of FCC projects. 

**Thoughts:** This weekend I have successfully refactored the code on 3 of my 5 total projects for FCC. These 3 projects now don't have any Bootstrap and are all native CSS and JS. I'm glad that my public code is now ever so slightly better but I'm also looking forward to working on something new once I've recoded the last 2. 

**Link to work:** [GitHub Page](https://github.com/D-Pagey/)

### Day 50: 4th December 2017

**Today's Progress:** Relaid out the Weather project natively.  

**Thoughts:** This project seems a bit more fiddly as I'm not thrilled with the design but don't have inspiration otherwise. I've sorted the basic layout in native CSS and getting more and more comfortable with Flexbox. Now I've just got to work out how to style a page based off multiple weather scenarios.

### Day 51: 10th December 2017

**Today's Progress:** All projects now native CSS and mobile responsive.

**Thoughts:** Today I finished off restyling the last of my projects in native CSS and making it mobile responsive. The process of rewriting all that code has definitely improved my CSS which was the goal. Now to move on to new projects and keep working towards the FCC certification.

### Day 52: 11th December 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Twitch TV project.

**Thoughts:** Laid out the foundations for the Twitch TV project. Seems like it could be a straight forward project given the Wikipedia project but too early to say.

### Day 53: 26th December 2017

**Today's Progress:** Link to stream + starting mobile responsive design.

**Thoughts:** I've managed to pull the relevant data from Twitch and display it. However, I am stuck because it works perfectly but for  one stream whereas the other streams it doesn't work at all. I don't really know where I'm going wrong so will have to do more research and will play around with it, however I think I'll post on StackOverFlow and the FCC forums to see if that helps. In the meantime, I will redesign the app for mobile.

### Day 54: 30th December 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished TwitchTV project.

**Thoughts:** Today I finally finished the Twitch TV project which also means I have completed the FCC Intermediate FE projects. Overall it was relatively straight forward given the previous 3 projects, but I still feel like I learnt a lot in the process of doing it. This is quite exciting for me as I couldn't really see myself getting to the Advanced FE projects but now I'm here, I feel ready for it.

### Day 55: 4th January 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2/3 user stories on Calculator project.

**Thoughts:** I've actually done lots of coding in between the last entry, I just haven't had time to log it. I started the calculcator project in an airport and have put in 4-5 hours on it since. I've now completed the core functionality and just fixing some bugs. This was a challenging and fun project and I still learnt a lot, and it has given me confidence to tackle the next Advanced projects.

### Day 56: 5th January 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished Calculator project.

**Thoughts:** Fixed 2 of the bugs and restyled it for mobile. Pretty happy with the project overall but would like to come back to it once my CSS skills have improved. Pretty happy that I managed to do and Advanced FCC project in about a week. It's given me the confidence to do the remaining 3 and earn that certificate!

### Day 57: 10th January 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added modal to Tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I have actually been coding a bit the last few days but not logged it. Anyway, I recently learnt how to create a modal page and so decided to add that to my Tribute project. I also took the chance to update and refactor my CSS to make it mobile responsive. I'm undecided as to whether or not move on to Pomodoro clock or add modals to my old projects as well.

### Day 58: 21st January 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added SCSS media queries to Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** I learnt the basics of SASS this weekend. I implemented my new knowledge to convert my CSS media queries in to SCSS media queries. It looks a bit chaotic but it works, will likely have to refactor this again at some point with best practices. 

This weekend has been tough on coding. It's been a while since I've had to learn something from scratch (SCSS), and lost a bit of confidence. I think I try to do everything too quickly and don't allow myself time to wrap my head around something. However, by coding on my projects, I remembered that I just need to keep hacking my way through slowly but surely.

### Day 59: 3rd February 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added Modal and SCSS to Wikipedia. 

**Thoughts:** Recently I have been learning to use SCSS to write better media queries by refactoring all my old projects. I have also taken this time to add Modals describing the user stories for each project. On one hand it's a bit tedious going over old code again but on the other hand, it's cool getting more and more used to thinking in terms of SCSS.

### Day 60: 4th February 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started on Consensus project. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to start on a personal project today. I intially wanted to do it once I had completed the FCC curriculum, but I had a strong urge to start it now as I think it will take me ages to get it functioning. Essentially it's an app to track interviewers' feedback after an interview, which is a bit of a pain point in my current job. It would be awesome to build something that I could use every day, but even if it doesn't get used then I will learn a lot whilst building it.

### Day 61: 5th February 2018

**Today's Progress:** Built form for Consensus project. 

**Thoughts:** I rebuilt the layout as a form with dropdown elements, I also restyled the layout for mobiles. In reading through MDN docs I feel like I have a better understanding for how forms work. 

It feels slightly different working on a project that I'm quite invested in. Working on the FCC Pomodoro is interesting but I likely won't use it and don't have much drive to complete it beyond the user stories (mainly as I have 2 more projects to do straight after). Whereas this is a personal project I could see myself using every day at work and I feel like I'm learning some new parts of the front end.

### Day 62: 11th February 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added pages to Consensus project and learning about Firebase. 

**Thoughts:** I've built the HTML and CSS for the various pages of my Consensus project. Now I just need to set up the Firebase database to list the interviewers and write the neccessary JavaScript. I'm in the stage of having to watch a lot of videos and read a lot of documentation, but I think I'll be able to build the database today.

### Day 63: 12th February 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Adding "Delete" functionality to the Interviewers CRUD application. 

**Thoughts:** Pretty happy that I managed to work out how to delete an entry in one hour on a weekday evening. This will be my first CRUD application and it's using an external database which is quite cool. Pretty excited at the future possibilities once I work out how to "Update" on this app. I find it difficult to understand what's going on with Firebase, but once I hack through it, I feel a lot more comfortable.

### Day 64: 17th February 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Restyled Pomodoro Clock. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to come back to my FCC project as I would like to earn the Free Code Camp certification at some point. I started on the functionality and then restyled the whole app. I still don't like the design but at least now the layout is good enough for me to work on the JavaScript side of the project. On the scripting side, my old code is redundant and I have found a better way to make a countdown clock. However, my old code laid the foundations for my understanding of this project.

### Day 65: 19th February 2018 

**Today's Progress:** First draft finished Pomodoro project.

**Thoughts:** I finished all the user stories for the Pomodoro project. The app is still quite buggy with a few more things I would like to add. However, I want to focus on new projects and learning objectives, like learning React. On one hand, I'm glad to have "finished" another advanced project, but on the other hand, I'm not super proud of my end result.

### Day 66: 25th February 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Starting to learn React.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with POST, DELETE and PUT HTTP requests in Fetch for my Consensus project, and concluded that I was going to focus on learning React instead. Today I have been focussing on reading through materials and watching videos. Unfortunately, I am struggling to get to grips with React and knowing where to start with it all. There are loads of things I don't fully understand from Webpack, NPM, ES6, Classes, Export, Import, where to right my code etc.

### Day 67: 28th February 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Working through React tutorials.

**Thoughts:** I found some great learning resources for React: FreeCodeCamp Beta, Hacking with React and the React tic-tac-toe tutorial. I've been working through these and found that the more React I write, the more I feel like I understand it. Overall, I'm feeling more optimistic about my chances of building a project in React.

### Day 68: 5th March 2018 

**Today's Progress:** Still working through React tutorials.

**Thoughts:** Did some exercises to become more comfortable with ES6. Still working through freeCodeCamp Beta React exercises as well as Hacking with React. I need to start building apps in React soon to put the theory into practice. It is starting to make sense in my head so I am excited to actually start building my own projects in React.

### Day 69: 6th March 2018 

**Today's Progress:** FCC Beta React tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Surprised at how extensive this React tutorial on FCC is but feel like I am learning a lot and all the things I was confused about is slowly clicking into place. The exercises are really well made! Not sure whether to continue or deviate into building a stateless React app.
